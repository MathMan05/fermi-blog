Hello, I'm a college student who's studying Computer Science. I've made several FOSS projects, including:
# [Fermi](https://fermi.chat/)
A FOSS Spacebar web client allowing people to login, register and chat on spacebar while being feature packed and quick to load due to its small footprint.
# [WebRARS](https://github.com/MathMan05/WebRARS)
A web version of RARS, it's very incomplete, but it is usable.

I am also looking for employment if you are interested please reach out [here](mailto:mathium@fermi.chat)
