# What's the deal with Spacebar?
There is a lot to say about Spacebar, lets start off with some of the good things about it.

Good things about Spacebar:

- Bridge bot support is excellent
	* It's pretty good with the ability to set per message pfps/usernames allowing for one bot without webhook perms to be a rather effective bridge.
- Fully FOSS
- The client is meant for discord like communication
- The Bot libraries are decent
	* though this just means that you can use the discord libs in this case
- Discord API compatible

## Smaller Issues with Spacebar

### Development Stagnation
Spacebar has had a bad case of development being rather slow, while this isn't exactly an issue, it does mean that updates are slower to roll out. Though most users care about client updates more than server updates, which on Fermi have been quite a bit faster.

### No Stable Releases
Spacebar nor Fermi have stable releases, you're just rocking the most recent version of either all of the time. This in itself isn't really an issue, though it does make it harder to self host given the constant minor updates. With Fermi a stable release is planned for sooner rather than later, though when exactly this will happen, I'm still not sure about.

## Final Thoughts
While I have much less to say about Spacebar than Revolt/Stoat it's due to the fact that it mostly works as intended, and does not have many of the organizational issues that they have.
