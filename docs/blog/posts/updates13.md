# Invite improvements
Sorry for the late post y'all, been busy and been taking a break after all of the busy-ness to try to get back into the swing of things. 
<!-- more -->
(In case y'all are curious I've been working on my RISCV IDE for fun, it's not as hard as it sounds lol)

### The Best Way of Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests
If you want to be credited and have better chances of your ideas coming to life please [submit an issue on github](https://github.com/MathMan05/Fermi/issues)! This makes things easier for me as everything is in one place, and you can be credited in the blog posts as well via a link to the issue you have created!

If you guys have anything you'd like to see feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/MathMan05/Fermi/issues/new) or say your ideas in the [Fermi Spacebar guild](https://fermi.chat/invite/USgYJo?instance=https%3A%2F%2Fspacebar.chat) or even the [Spacebar Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JDjMXTGeY9)
