# Various Improvements
A steady pace forward with various improvements to Fermi, which includes improving the home page and some minor work on interactions and whatnot.

<!-- more -->


## this weeks updates

### More Interaction Work
* String inputs on commands now support choices
* Invalid inputs now show an error for commands
* Required inputs now also error if they're not included

### Documentation On How to Statically Host
[I now have documentation on how to statically host Fermi!](https://github.com/MathMan05/Fermi/blob/main/howToStaticallyHost.md)
### Improved Home Page
The home page has been reworked slightly, along with a new slideshow a the top showing screenshots of the client in action to show new users what Fermi is capable of!

### Minor improvements
* [Blobmoji is now an option in the emoji picker](https://github.com/MathMan05/Fermi/issues/145)
	* Thanks to [illyria for implementing this!](https://github.com/MathMan05/Fermi/pull/152)

### Bug fixes
* Fixed various things that'll let Fermi work on FF 115

* [Fix SQLite support](https://github.com/spacebarchat/server/pull/1372)

### Sorry Again for the Less Active Week
I know that making software like this is a marathon, not a sprint, but I do want to publish more features, though I've not gotten as much done this week as I'd like and I'm publishing this a day late (sorry about that). I hope to get more features done next week! Please keep on submitting issues and letting me know when something goes wrong/can be improved.

### The Best Way of Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests
If you want to be credited and have better chances of your ideas coming to life please [submit an issue on github](https://github.com/MathMan05/Fermi/issues)! This makes things easier for me as everything is in one place, and you can be credited in the blog posts as well via a link to the issue you have created!

If you guys have anything you'd like to see feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/MathMan05/Fermi/issues/new) or say your ideas in the [Fermi Spacebar guild](https://fermi.chat/invite/USgYJo?instance=https%3A%2F%2Fspacebar.chat) or even the [Spacebar Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JDjMXTGeY9)
