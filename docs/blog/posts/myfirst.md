# Finally got the blog engine up and running

After nearly a month after the polls of people wanting to see a blog about Fermi, it's finally happened, I've made a blog. I am going to try to do weekly updates on the status of Fermi or various other projects as they come up. (Though don't be surprised if I don't do a post every week)

I tried to set this up a few weeks ago, though I failed as I couldn't get the engine to work, turns out I forgot to install a few deps that made it not want to work, and now that they're installed everything seems to be fine and dandy.

If anyone has suggestions on what things I may have missed on this blog, feel free to inform me so I may correct it or make various improvements.
