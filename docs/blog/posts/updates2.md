description: Fermi has gained FireFox WebRTC support allowing for firefox users to join Voice chats assuming the server has it enabled
---
# Firefox WebRTC

Firefox WebRTC is finally working with a few other minor updates.

<!-- more -->

### Firefox WebRTC
Firefox is now able to join Voice channels(of course if enabled on the server), and do everything chromium is able to do. This is a huge step forward in Fermi's Voice implementation, which after this I'll have to go through and polish the interface.

### Minor improvements
* Attachment reply text now has space afterwards
* Emoji in replies are now regular sized

### Bug fixes
* Refreshed URLs should now save causing less flashing
* Markdown spoilers now work on dark-accent theme
* Videos in Voice chats no longer pause when you switch channels
* Videos in Voice chats now will fit their box instead of overflowing it

### Sorry for the more lackluster week
I've been busy with school stuff and motivation is rough, I hope to polish WebRTC next week and have more updates.
