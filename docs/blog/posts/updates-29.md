# The last 3 weeks in Fermi

There've been various improvements, including an admin finder, an Emoji font selector, Markdown improvements and a barrage of bug fixes. 

<!-- more -->
### Sorry for being late
I know I've missed two weeks, but this post will try to cover the last 3 weeks, though not a tonne happened those first two weeks due to being busier with stuff.

### Admin Finder
I've implemented an admin finder panel to more easily let people find the people with moderator privileges, instead of having to guess by the role names.

### Emoji Font Selector
There's now a selector for the font that your emoji will come from!
