# Less active week

Not a tonne happened this week, but there were some bug fixes
<!-- more -->

I plan to finish my finding admins menu, though it's still a WIP, and I am thinking about creating a bot for spacebar to help give spacebar a functional bot to use for moderation and whatnot, but I'm still not sure, feel free to comment bellow if you have any ideas of what features you'd like to see in a bot.

### Bug fixes
* CSS for pop ups no longer enforced large sizes
* ADMINISTRATOR role no longer shows all roles as being had
* Context menus in popups now act normally and will go away

If you guys have anything you'd like to see feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/MathMan05/Fermi/issues/new) or say your ideas in the [Fermi Spacebar guild](https://fermi.chat/invite/USgYJo?instance=https%3A%2F%2Fspacebar.chat) or even the [Spacebar Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JDjMXTGeY9)
